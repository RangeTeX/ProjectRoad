# Project Road GovHack 2018
## NXT Branch (Post GovHack)
Vicroads manages approximately 23,000 kilometres of arterial road network across Victoria, which is worth over $20 billion. Imagine the maintenance upkeep for such an infrastructure. Current systems involve periodic inspections of roads.

The current process for this involves

- Manually checking
- Complaints to council/vicroads
- Time based not info based
- Doesnâ€™t take into account local conditions, geography, weather
We set out to assist in improving this process
