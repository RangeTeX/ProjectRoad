    <h3>The problem</h3>
    <p>Vicroads manages approximately 23,000 kilometres of arterial road network across Victoria, which is worth over
        $20 billion. Imagine the maintenance upkeep for such an infrastructure. Current systems involve periodic
        inspections of roads.</p>
    <p>The current process for this involves</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Manually checking</li>
        <li>Complaints to council/vicroads</li>
        <li>Time based not info based</li>
        <li>Doesnâ€™t take into account local conditions, geography, weather</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We set out to assist in improving this process.</p>


    <h3>The solution</h3>
    <p>Project Road uses VicRoads traffic volume data to show possible hotspots of road damage.</p>

    <p>Using VicRoads Crash data we can also see a link between heavy use roads as well as damaged roads and crash
        incidents.</p>

    <p>The BOM Australian Landscape Water Balance data would allow Project Road to make predictions on road degradation
        due to landmass changes.</p>
    <h3>Long term</h3>
    <p>Project Road would benefit from the development of smart integrated devices that would provide direct information
        about roads and what condition they are in to then further help road maintenance crew find roads that are
        failing due to unforeseen events like weather affecting the underlying water ground moisture and crashes that
        could affect the road and its structure.</p>
